# Population and Gender Distribution Visualization
### Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for visualizing population data across different countries and years using bar charts. 
The scripts utilize World Bank-style population data and gender distribution statistics to create clear and informative visualizations.
### Data Sources
- Total Population (2015–2019): Simulated population data for India, China, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil.
- Gender Distribution (2022): Estimated male and female population numbers for selected countries.
### Implementation
- Used pandas for data manipulation and structuring.
- Used matplotlib for visualization.
- Transposed population data to compare growth trends over time.
- Created stacked bar charts to represent gender distribution in different countries.
### Visualizations
### 1 Total Population by Country (2015–2019)
- Displays the population growth for five countries over five years.
- Helps analyze demographic trends.
### 2 Gender Distribution by Country (2022)
- Represents male and female populations in various countries.
- Uses a stacked bar chart for clarity.
### How to Use
- Install dependencies: pip install pandas matplotlib
- Run the script to generate the plots.
- The graphs will be displayed in separate windows.
